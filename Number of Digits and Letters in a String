Write a Python Program to calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Description The program takes a string and calculates the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a character is encountered. 4. Print the total count of both the variables. 5. Exit.


str=input()
ch=0
di=0
for i in str:
    if i>='0' and i<='9':
        di=di+1
    else:
        ch=ch+1
print("Characters=",ch)
print("Digits=",di)
